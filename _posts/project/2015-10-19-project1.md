# Human inspired Bio-Pneumatic ARM

## An anthoropomorphic manipulator arm with 7 degree of freedom


Pneumatic ARM is an experimental setup to study the inherent compliance in robotic system, It is designed with articial muscles as actuators in agonistic and antagonistic fashion. The robot is projected to perform explosive tasks like throwing balls and hammering with maximum speed. The ongoing projects has several work packages.Students can join the project and discuss with the project owner about their responsibilities.  

Project Level: Undergraduate to Phd

Project scope: 

* Study and develop a dynamic model for a joint.
* Develop a URDF and 3D model and simulate the dynamics in Simulator
* System identification for the joint
* Design PID controller to track a reference position
* Study the sources and effects of non linearities
* Design ILQR controller to deal with the non linearities in the actuator model

Requirements:
Students from all level from undergraduate to Phd level can join this project

Reccomended background: Mechanical, Electronics/Eectrical, computer Science and similar
